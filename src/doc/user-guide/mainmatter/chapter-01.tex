\chapter{Project Architecture}
\section{Components}
Following the client-server model, this project haves two sides (or
applications) and witch one with yours features.

\subsection{Software}
\subsubsection{Server side}
Responsible for pass the received data to the Arduino board.\\

In the future, such data will be processed by the server application before
release the signals. But such feature isn't implemented.\\

Is important to note the server application should not be accessible to the final
user. Even in the computer used as server, there should be a client application
if such machine is able to control de devices.

\subsubsection{Client side}

\subsection{Languages}
\subsubsection{Arduino}
\subsubsection{Java}
\subsection{Hardware}
\subsubsection{RCHome Main Board}
\subsubsection{Relay Modules}
