1. INSTALL

        The build process is automated by a ant file, in 'build/' directory.
        You can compile the  whole code and documentation just typing:

        cd build/
        ant

        But there are others targets for partial compilation, like:

        * Build server side:
        ant build-server

        * Build client side:
        ant build-client

        * Build JavaDoc documentation:
        ant build-doc

        After all, you can clean the compiled files, the commands follows the
        same syntax, just changing "build" for "clean", like:

        * Clean the server side:
        ant clean-server

        The target packages are:

        ant build; and
        ant clean

        These target call all of three other targets({server,client,doc}).

2. RUN
        After build the source code, run the jar files.
        For run the server side, type:
        cd build/
        java -jar RCHome-server_0.01.jar

        Similarly, the client side in Java is:
        cd build/
        java -jar RCHome-client.01.jar
